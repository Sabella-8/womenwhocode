        <p id="textLeft">In 2018, Fitbit released backlash after launching their period tracking update because the software restricted people from tracking a period for longer than 10 days. This caused outrage that Fitbit had failed to take into account that some people menstruate for longer than this, and that people should not have limitations placed
    on how long they can track their period for. Further complaints centered around limitations on trackin symptoms, which were restricted to just five options; cramps, acne, headache, tender breasts, and sick. It was clear that this feature had been developed with little no input from anyone who actually menstruates.</p>
